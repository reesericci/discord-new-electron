# discord-new-electron

I packaged discord with the latest version of electron as an appimage to bring better performance, security, and featureset. It even includes wayland support*!

If you want discord_arch_electron but on other distros (assuming your goal is to use the latest electron, if you want to pin, sorry.) this is it!

# Installation

Grab the appimage from the releases tab, make it executable, and run it! If you want to integrate it, look up AppImageLauncher by the assassin.

Or use zap, the AppImage package manager (the best way to install AppImages)
```
zap install --github --from reesericci/discord-new-electron
```
